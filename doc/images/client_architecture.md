# Utilizing React and Redux to manage UI Components in Phaser.
Let me start by saying I am not the most versed with Phaser, in fact this is my first larger project aside from the provided tutorials and examples on the website. In all my previous projects I've always ran into the issue with forms, user input, and updating game state to reflect the changes. Such an example was a simple interactive game to navigate a finite amount of states and render a different scene to reflect the change -- potentially prompt a scenario where the user would utilze a previously found item. Granted this was easily doable and I could build my projects with webpack and ES6 without incident, testing became a major issue with validating the results of the user interaction. Headless browser testing with Phaser, due to limitations with Pixi, also became a struggle.
